    "Unfortunately the above get caricatured down to not quite true claims such as the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Optimizing in <code>R<sup>n</sup></code> is easy because the probability of a [stationary point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_point) being a local minima falls ofg exponentially in `n`. The misplaced fear of local minima comes from low dimensional experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implication doesn't hold in common practical work for a number of reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Unconstrained optimizers stop for a great number of reasons *other* than hitting local minima. A few of these include: low norm gradients, large flat regions, iteration bounds, and numeric instability. It isn't enough to eliminate \"false stops at local minima.\"\n",
    "  * Linear independence in this context isn't enough to establish statistical independence. Losing to a great number of simultaneous conditions can be *easy* if the conditions are correlated.\n",
    "  * The original references had to assume or establish a number of additional conditions to put a favorable probabilistic model on the stationary points. If you are not in similar circumstances (such as exploring the properties of a spin-glass or eigenvectors of random matrices) you should *not* expect similar properties.\n",
    "  * Even if most states are nice, optimizers search for exceptional ones. The desired global minimum itself being the most exceptional one. Even if local minima are rare *in proportion to stationary points*, there could still be a lot of them compared to the number of global optima. So they may still drown out the globally optimum solutions. This is a common \"[base rate fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy)\": each attempt to spoil the optimizer may have a low chance of spoiling- but if there are enough attempts they have a good chance to spoil the optimization in aggregate.\n"

This is a major source of non-convexity and difficulty in this formulation. A gradient aware optimizer taking sufficiently small steps can never change the order of the `x(i)` versus `x(j)`, as it would experience bad objective values as `x(i)` and `x(j)` take on close intermediate values as they try to trade places. Of course, this can be mitigated with large steps, annealing, and stochastic ideas. \n",

Our optimizer starts possibly trapped in one such region, and the globally optimal solution is likely inaccessible in another. Each valley has a large ridge system or boundary that makes it difficult to escape. There are not \"cheap random gaps or passes\" in the ridges, as the ridges in this high dimensional configuration space come from simple facts such as the relative order of `x(i)` and `x(j)`.\n",

It is really worth a read, as it is relating global optimization to an actual global property. However, to say \"if\" the system percolates (or more precisely all the level sets percolate, or a single percolation can be striated into many) is not quite the same as knowing the system percolates. And, as we have seen, problem structure can cause a partition that block such global access.\n",

    "  * It isn't just local features (such as local minima) that make unconstrained global optimization hard. Global optimization is often hard due to global structure. Many problems have non-trivial global structure.\n",
    "  * Unconstrained optimizers tend to stop or fail for reasons other then hitting local minima. They tend to step at points with merely low norm gradients that are not in fact even critical or stationary points (let alone local minima).\n",
    "  * Most operations research problems have a lot of structure and symmetries. These can partition the optimization space into a large number of large non-communicating regions. Even deep learning problems can have global structure, as they may need to break a symmetry by realizing some functionality in one part of a network or another.\n",
    "  * Many low dimensional bugbears do in fact have easy high dimensional analogues. For example a long nearly flat region in a 1-d problem, can arise in 2-d as a pie tin, or in n-d as a ball.\n",
    "  * Optimizers are quite easy to break when one tries. And nature tries hard. It is only when one pretends optimization is easy that long run times are considered proof of optimality.\n",
    "  * In my opinion classical machine learning and optimization lulled people into a false sense of security by supplying spectacular optimization results. However, most of these results were hard won by establishing strict conditions such as convexity. In deep learning even if your loss function (square loss, deviance, entropy, cross entropy) is convex your overall system of data -> parameters -> prediction -> loss is not going to be convex. This is especially true when you are dealing with billions of datums, and deep nets with billions of parameters simultaneously. When your objective function is literally billions of time more complex than your optimizer- it isn't obvious your optimizer wins.\n"
